All of my code and results from the datasets are in this repository. For convenience, I have also added my two assigned datasets: 39 for the small dataset, 9 for the large dataset.
<br/><br/>
The code for this project is in the file: project2_ai.py. The entire revision history is in the header of this file.
<br/><br/>
I included the results from my assigned datasets in .txt files, with the search type used, size of dataset, and dataset number listed in the file name. I also added some of the results from the two example small datasets provided (86 and 61), which I used to check my code before running my assigned datasets.
